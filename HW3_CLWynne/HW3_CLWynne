# Unit 3 | Assignment - Py Me Up, Charlie



# ![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.jpg)

# * In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing  # the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data     # called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is       # composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, your company    # has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

# * Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate 
# each of the following:

#  * The total number of months included in the dataset
#  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

#  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

#  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# * As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

#  ```text
#  Financial Analysis
#  ----------------------------
#  Total Months: 86
#  Total: $38382578
#  Average  Change: $-2315.12
#  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
#  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
#  ```

# * In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal  # and #export a text file with the results.
